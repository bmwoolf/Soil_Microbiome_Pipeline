# Soil Microbiome Pipeline (Cloud + Nextflow)

## Overview
This project is a practice pipeline for analyzing soil microbiome 16S rRNA data using Nextflow, Docker, Kraken2, and MultiQC. The goal is to build a reproducible workflow that can run locally or on the cloud, and generate an HTML/PDF report summarizing the results.

## Project Structure

```
/data      # Raw and processed data
/pipeline  # Nextflow pipeline scripts
/docker    # Dockerfiles and configs
/results   # Output from pipeline runs
/reports   # MultiQC reports
/scripts   # Helper scripts (e.g., data download)
```

## Steps
1. Download public 16S rRNA soil dataset
2. Run Kraken2 for taxonomic classification (via Nextflow pipeline)
3. Aggregate and visualize results with MultiQC
4. Generate HTML/PDF report

## Requirements
- Docker
- Nextflow

## Getting Started
Instructions will be added as the pipeline is developed.
